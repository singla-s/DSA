### Jakarta Context & Dependency Injection (CDI):

1. CDI is a specification (interface). Spring framework implements CDI.
2. Important Annotations:
   * Inject - same as Autowired in Spring.
   * Named - same as Component in Spring.
   * Qualifier
   * Scope
   * Singleton
3. Stereotype Annotations:
   * Component - POJO or model class
   * Service - If a class has business logic
   * Repository - If the class is interacting with DataStorage, DB etc.
   * Controller

### Spring Boot vs Traditional Approach:
1. Spring boot provides following out of the box features which were needed to be manually configured earlier.
   * **Tomcat** server within jar files(embedded server)
   * **Auto configuration** - that includes required packages to fast creation of java app.
   * **Maven** integration provides package management and generation of build files, as well as jar file.

Important notes:
Run jar file: **java -jar name-of-thejar.jar**
